This project involved analyzing approximately 500,000 instances of daily customer purchase data from an online retail store, specifically focusing on order cancellations. By studying demographic information and individual order histories, valuable insights regarding customer purchasing patterns were uncovered.

To ensure data integrity, extensive Data Cleaning and Pre-processing were conducted, followed by SQL-based KPI analysis and Data Visualization using Power BI. The analysis covered key Profitability Metrics, such as Total Revenue per Customer, Average Order Value, Top-Selling Products, and Sales by Country. Additionally, risk metrics were examined, including product return rate, high-risk products per country, and average order returns per country, to help identify potential business risks.

This study provided actionable insights that could enhance revenue strategies, optimize product offerings, and mitigate financial risks in an online retail environment.
